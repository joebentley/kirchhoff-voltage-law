### TODO

* ~~Draw circuit diagram~~

* ~~Add MathJaX support~~

* ~~Add static resistors and voltage and display current & voltage across each resistors~~

* ~~Add variable resistors~~

  * ~~HTML textboxes over the top of circuit diagram~~

  * ~~Use fixed supply voltage and recalculate current & voltage across resistors in real-time~~


* ~~Display Kirchhoff's Voltage Law & equations in LaTeX~~
